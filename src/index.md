# Welcome

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in other languages. The language provides constructs intended to make clear programs possible on both a small and large scale.

This developer room is a good occasion to discover the Python ecosystem and meet the community around this language.

For this edition, we will follow the same Code of Conduct of the Python Software Foundation
